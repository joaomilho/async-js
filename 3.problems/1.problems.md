# Problems
----------------

1. Executes immediately.

2. Small API to deal with other use cases:
      Missing `any`, `recover`, `cancel` etc...

3. No distinction between resolve types:
     `then` works both with values and promises.

4. No built in way of differentiating problems:
     Expected issues are treated as exceptions.

5. No built in way of dealing with multiple values.
